      <h2>Spade Pirates</h2>
      <p>The Spade Pirates was the former pirate crew of <b>Portgas D. Ace</b> that was founded five years before the current storyline. 
        The crew later disbanded when its members integrated into the Whitebeard Pirates. The Spade Pirates' Jolly Roger is a normal 
        grinning skull and crossbones wearing Ace's signature hat, which has two "smileys", one smiling and the other frowning. 
        The top of the hat has flames protruding from it, a representation of Ace's fire-based abilities. 
        The background of the skull is a spade and the word "SPADE" is beneath it. The Spade Pirates were powerful enough to make it through Paradise. 
        Their captain, <b>Ace, managed to fight on equal terms with one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea, Jinbe, for five days straight,</b> as well as being offered a position as a Warlord himself. 
        The crew also showed a lack of fear, as they attempted to attack Whitebeard in order to save their captain despite knowing that they were outmatched.</p>

      <h2>ASL Brotherhood</h2>
      <p>
        
        The ASL brothers continued their adventures until someone recognized Sabo. Luffy and Ace egged him to reveal the man's identity, 
        so Sabo admitted the truth of his real status as a noble. The other two accepted Sabo for who he was, and the three kids exchanged 
        cups of sake to commemorate being sworn brothers. Even though the three were able to continue causing trouble,
         it was short-lived; Sabo promised his father to leave as long as he wouldn't let the others get hurt.
<br>
<br>
        The brothers faced further devastation in One Piece after learning of Sabo's supposed death at the hand of a Celestial Dragon, 
        and were completely separated when Ace sailed away after turning 17. The next time they met was when Ace greeted the Straw Hat Pirates 
        as they fled from Smoker. But another tragedy befell Luffy when<b> Ace died during the Paramount War, </b>bleading Luffy to believe both his brothers were dead.</p>
